# POS + Inventory Management System

A complete **Point of Sale (POS) and Inventory Management** system designed in two parts:  
1. **Admin Panel** – Manage products, apply deals, register stores, and maintain stock.  
2. **POS Screen** – Works like a cashier’s software to scan products, apply discounts automatically, generate bills, and track reports.

This project is built using **React (Vite)**, **Firebase Authentication**, and **Firestore Database**, designed as a **SaaS model** for scalability.
